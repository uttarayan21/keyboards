# Vendors

I'm from India and so I usually buy from local indian vendors.

## Keyboard parts
I primarily buy parts from the following vendors

- neomacro.in: I have bought gateron oil kings and keycaps here
- stackskb.com: Bought my monsgeek m1 here
- kprepublic.com: Only used for keycaps

Vendors I personally haven't used but heard good things about
- meckeys.com
- genesicpc.in: keyboards switches keycaps mouse-switches

Vendors I have used and **did NOT** have a good experience
- cablesutra.com
    I bought their Sofle v2 build which took a few months to arrive and was absolutely terrible.
    The standoff in the 3d printed case broke off when screing in had no threaded inserts or anything.
    The acrylic cover for the display was cut out of a pure black acrylic sheet and couldn't be modified.
    They modified the qmk source and didn't publish their fork so anyone trying to program the keyboard would have to trace out the pcb and make patches themselves.
    When talking to support they ghosted from weeks / months at a time and I still haven't gotten the source for the keyboard.
    I also bought a coiled trrs cable from them which seems okay.
    Overall a pretty negative experience.

- beekeeb.com: Could only find nice!view's here (60$ for two Oof)

## Electronics
Since aliexpress is banned in india I haven't been able to get niche parts which are either completely unavailable or very expensive in India.
For electronics I primarily buy from the following vendors

- robu.in: While their shipping is really slow they are reliable and usually have the largest variety. (really slow: do not order pcbs through them)
- ktron.in: Really fast shipping times on the items they stock (30mins from order) and they delivered it next day to Delhi
- robokits.co.in: Had some nice!nano compatible Supermini nrf52840s here
- fabtolab.com: Only ones who had a Pinecil V2 in stock at a reasonable price in India
- jlcpcb.com: Pretty expensive but really fast and good quality pcb printing

## 3d printing

- ideal3d.in: They are the only place I have bought 3d printer stuff from as of yet (Bambu Lab P1S and some filament)

Others that I have heard are reliable

- wol3d.com: The bambu lab p1s combo was out of stock here so didn't buy from here.
